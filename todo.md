# Week 1 (Finish by Saturday - 1/8)

## Step 1 - Methods to implement

- default constructor and constructor that takes an array
- toString
- addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast
- ~~getFirst~~, ~~getLast~~, ~~getLength~~, ~~isEmpty~~

The iterator methods will be covered in the week 2 lessons, as will the equals method and the copy constructor.

## Step 2 - Update pre and postconditions

- preconditions indicate what conditions must be met BEFORE the user calls the method. The method will not work properly unless the preconditions are met.
- Postconditions indicate what will be the result of the method call. In other words, what conditions will exist after the method is called.

## Step 3 - JUnit tests (LinkedListTest.java)

You should create your JUnit tests _as you are write each method_

Remember that there must be 3 tests per method. Therefore, inside each @Test method, you should write 3 tests by calling one of the following test methods:

- assertEquals()
- assertNotEquals()
- assertTrue()
- assertFalse()
- assertThrows()

## To Come Back to

- testRemoveLast()
- testToString()
- testArrayConstructor
- ArrayConstructor
